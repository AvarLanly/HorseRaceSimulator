Steps To Be Able To Run Program (Textual Version):
1. Ensure that a JDK is installed on the computer (Preferably JDK 21 or newer)
2. Run the program by either using an IDE or the Command Prompt

Command Prompt:
1. Ensure that the directory is located where the java file is by using the command: 'cd (address of program folder)'
2. Simply use the command: 'java Main.java'. If that doesn't work, simply use this command: 'javac Main.java' to ensure the file is compiled before you try to run it again.
3. The program should now run as normal. Use the command 'java Main.java' again to run the program again.

IDE:
1. Simply click on the run button, and make sure it runs Main.java.
